# Drill

Drill is a HTTP load testing application written in Rust. The main goal
for this project is to build a really lightweight tool as alternative to other
that require JVM and other stuff.

You can write benchmark files, in YAML format, describing all the stuff you
want to test.

It was inspired by [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html)
syntax because it is really easy to use and extend.

Here is an example for **benchmark.yml**:

```yaml
---

concurrency: 4
base: 'http://localhost:9000'
iterations: 5
rampup: 2

plan:
  - name: Include comments
    include: comments.yml

        X-Bar: Bar {{ memory.headers.token }}

  - name: One request with a random item
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ item }}
    with_items:
      - 70
      - 73

    shuffle: true
    pick: 1

  - name: Three requests with random items from a range
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ item }}
    with_items_range:
      start: 1
      stop: 1000
    shuffle: true
    pick: 3
```

As you can see, you can play with interpolations in different ways. This
will let you specify a benchmark with different requests and
dependencies between them.

If you want to know more about the benchmark file syntax, [read this](./SYNTAX.md)

## Install

Right now, the easiest way to get `drill` is to go to the
[latest release](https://github.com/fcsonline/drill/releases/latest)
page and download the binary file for your platform.


Another way to install `drill`, if you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) available in
your system, is with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```
cargo install drill
drill --benchmark benchmark.yml --stats
```

or download the source code and compile it:

```
git clone git@github.com:fcsonline/drill.git && cd drill
cargo build --release
./target/release/drill --benchmark benchmark.yml --stats
```

### Dependencies

OpenSSL is needed in order to compile Drill, whether it is through `cargo install`
or when compiling from source with `cargo build`.

Depending on your platform, the name of the dependencies may differ.

#### Linux

Install `libssl-dev` and `pkg-config` packages with your favorite package manager
(if `libssl-dev` is not found, try other names like `openssl` or `openssl-devel`).

#### macOS

First, install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

And then install `openssl` with Homebrew.

#### Windows

First, install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html).

And then run `vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static-md`.

## Features

This is the list of all features supported by the current version of `drill`:

- **Concurrency:** run your benchmarks choosing the number of concurrent iterations.
- **Multi iterations:** specify the number of iterations you want to run the benchmark.
- **Ramp-up:** specify the amount of time, in seconds, that it will take `drill` to start all iterations.
- **Delay:** introduce controlled delay between requests. Example: [delay.yml](./example/delay.yml)
- **Dynamic urls:** execute requests with dynamic interpolations in the url, like `/api/users/{{ item }}`
- **Dynamic headers:** execute requests with dynamic headers. Example: [headers.yml](./example/headers.yml)
- **Interpolate environment variables:** set environment variables, like `/api/users/{{ EDITOR }}`
- **Executions:** execute remote commands with test plan data.
- **Assertions:** assert values during the test plan. Example: [iterations.yml](./example/iterations.yml)
- **Request dependencies:** create dependencies between requests with `assign` and url interpolations.
- **Split files:** organize your benchmarks in multiple files and include them.
- **CSV support:** read CSV files and build N requests fill dynamic interpolations with CSV data.
- **HTTP methods:** build request with different http methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD or DELETE.
- **Cookie support:** create benchmarks with sessions because cookies are propagates between requests.
- **Stats:** get nice statistics about all the requests. Example: [cookies.yml](./example/cookies.yml)
- **Thresholds:** compare the current benchmark performance against a stored one session and fail if a threshold is exceeded.
- **Tags:** specify test plan items by tags.

## Test it

Go to the `example` directory and you'll find a [README](./example) how
to test it in a safe environment.

**Disclaimer**: We really recommend not to run intensive benchmarks against
production environments.

## Contribute

This project started as a side project to learn Rust, so I'm sure that is full
of mistakes and areas to be improve. If you think you can tweak the code to
make it better, I'll really appreciate a pull request. ;)
